## UX

### Strategy
My goal in the design was to make a functioning website with easy access to all the information available in a user-friendly format.

### Scope
For the user, I wanted them to be able to browse through the different works created by the artist, learn a summary of his background with the option to contact him and have an opportunity to sign up for a newsletter to keep up to date with the artist's current happenings. 

### Structure
The site is made of four main pages starting with the home as the main site navigation hub, from there the user is able to browse to the about section to get a summery of the artist. Using the navigation bar the user can browse to the gallery page to view the artists artworks. Then the final page is a contact form where the user can interact with the artist and sign up for the newsletter.

[Contact](/other-files/mark-diggin-art-contact..jpg)

### Surface
The primary colors used were #031355 for the navigation bar and #DCDCDC for the footer, with the rest in white. I chose these colors as they complement the hero image and do not clash with any colors from the paintings displayed on the gallery page while keeping the content legible.

### Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS

### Features
This site features a navigation bar, a gallery, a home menu page, links to social media, a contact form,  a you-tube video and links to external resources.
### Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to add a feature that allows the user to view the art in a virtual sitting/room hall or bedroom to get an idea of how it may look, along with the ability to purchase off the site.
